<h2>ZF2010-07: Potential Security Issues in Bundled Dojo Library</h2>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>

<p>
    In mid-March, 2010, the Dojo Foundation issued a Security Advisory 
    indicating potential security issues with specific files in Dojo Toolkit.
    Details of the advisory may be found on the Dojo website:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li><a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/blog/post/dylan/2010/03/dojo-security-advisory/">http://dojotoolkit.org/blog/post/dylan/2010/03/dojo-security-advisory/</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    In particular, several files in the Dojo tree were identified as having 
    potential exploits, and the Dojo team also advised disabling or removing any 
    PHP scripts in the tree when deploying to production.
</p>

<h3>Action Taken</h3>

<p>
    Since the files in question have been patched on the Dojo release branches, 
    the only action needed was a new release that contains a new build of Dojo 
    based on the current release branch. In addition, code was added to the 
    Zend Framework Dojo build script to strip out all PHP files as an extra 
    precaution.
</p>

<h3>Recommendations</h3>

<p>
    This particular vulnerability only affects those users who:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Use Dojo, and more specifically,</li>
    <li>Use the Dojo build supplied by Zend Framework, or</li>
    <li>Have not updated their site already based on the recommendations of the 
    recent announcement by the Dojo Foundation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If you fall into one of these categories, we strongly recommend upgrading 
    to the latest available Zend Framework release, or one of the following 
    releases, immediately, and redeploying Dojo from the Dojo packages supplied 
    with Zend Framework:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li>1.10.3</li>
    <li>1.9.8</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Alternately, upgrade from official Dojo packages, following the guidelines 
    in the aforementioned advisory from the Dojo Foundation.
</p>

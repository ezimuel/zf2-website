    We welcome and encourage contributions to the Zend Framework community.
    Anyone may report issues or feature requests in our <a
    href="http://framework.zend.com/issues">issue tracker</a>, and ask questions
    and/or provide answers on the <a
    href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFDEV/Contributing+to+Zend+Framework#ContributingtoZendFramework-Subscribetotheappropriatemailinglists">mailing
    lists</a>. We also encourage you to publish articles or code on your own blog
    or website as well as on public blogs and web sites such as the <a
    href="http://devzone.zend.com">Zend Developer Zone</a>. However, <span
    style="font-weight: bold;">anything</span> that could constitute intellectual
    property (code patches, proposals) to be included in Zend Framework <b>must</b>
    be contributed under the terms of the Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
</p>

<div class="dotted-line"></div>

<p>
    Anyone wishing to contribute code, patches, and proposals to Zend Framework
    <b>must</b> complete two steps before anything is submitted:
</p>

<ol class="ol">
    <li>
        Read and understand the <a href="/license">New BSD License</a>, which
        is how all parts of Zend Framework (including all contributions to it) are
        licensed.
    </li>
    <li>
        Submit a signed CLA by either submitting an <a
        href="/framework_cla_1.0.pdf">Individual CLA</a> if you are submitting code as
        an individual or a <a href="/framework_cla_corporate_1.0.pdf">Corporate CLA</a>
        for anyone who is submitting code as an employee of a company.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    To submit a CLA, download and print one of the agreements above.
    Fill it out completely making sure to:
</p>

<ul class="ul">
    <li>Print <span style="font-weight: bold;">clearly</span>
        using <span style="font-weight: bold;">large letters</span></li>
    <li>Include your name and email address</li>
    <li>Include your Issue Tracker username (Don't have an Issue
        Tracker account? <a
        href="http://framework.zend.com/issues/secure/Signup%21default.jspa">
        Get one here!</a>)</li>
    <li>If we place your Issue Tracker username into the "developer
        group" within the Issue Tracker, other contributors will <b>know</b>
        that you signed the CLA, and that your submitted code and patches may
        be used. Unless we receive instructions from you for a confidential
        CLA, expect to have your Issue Tracker account placed into the
        "developer group". In some rare instances, a corporation might wish to
        make a confidential code contribution.</li>
    <li>Sign and date the CLA.</li>
</ul>

<p>When completed you may submit the CLA in one of three ways:</p>

<ol class="ol">
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Electronically:</span>
		Email a <b>1500+</b> pixel wide JPEG/PNG copy
		of the CLA to <a href="mailto:cla@zend.com">cla@zend.com</a>, or
  </li>
  <li>
  		Send a fax of the CLA to: +1-408-253-8801
		(if a scan is not possible) <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> send an email to
		<a href="mailto:cla@zend.com">cla@zend.com</a>, or
  </li>
  <li>
  		Send a signed version of the CLA via postal mail to:<br />
		Zend Technologies, Inc.<br />
		ATTN: Zend Framework CLA Agreements<br />
		19200 Stevens Creek Blvd.<br />
		Suite 100<br />
		Cupertino, CA 95014 USA<br />
		<span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> send an email to <a href="mailto:cla@zend.com">cla@zend.com</a>
  </li><br/>
</ol>

<p>
	When we receive a CLA we usually respond within
	5 business days. You will receive a confirmation
	of your CLA to the email address listed on the
	CLA. If you have not received confirmation of receipt within
	a reasonable period of time contact <a href="mailto:cla@zend.com">cla@zend.com</a>
    and we will try to resolve the issue.

<h4><a name="CLA1"></a>What does Contributor License Agreement (CLA) actually mean?</h4>

<p>
    By signing a CLA, the person contributing source code provides a copyright
    license to Zend to use the source code he submitted in Zend Framework.  By
    doing so, the contributor does not give up his own rights or copyright to his
    own code, but provides us with a copyright license. In addition, the purpose of
    the CLA is to clearly define the terms under which intellectual property has
    been contributed to Zend Framework and to make sure that to the best of the
    contributor's knowledge he is entitled to make such contribution and is not
    violating anyone else's intellectual property.
</p>

<h4><a name="CLA2"></a>This whole business around CLA sounds so corporate to
    me. I've been using lots of open-source projects for my business and never had
    any issues.</h4>
<p>
    Actually, the CLA doesn't just protect large companies; it protects all
    users including small and medium businesses and individuals. By having a CLA in
    place, we mitigate the risk that companies who claim intellectual property
    infringement may demand royalties or fees from users of Zend Framework,
    whether individuals or companies.  This is especially important for companies
    who are planning to base their business or products on Zend Framework.  The CLA
    helps to assure that the code and other IP in Zend Framework remains free.
</p>

<h4><a name="CLA3"></a>So how does the CLA actually protect the Zend Framework
    user base?</h4>
<p>
    As mentioned, by requiring contributors to sign a CLA, we mitigate the risk
    of accepting contributions which infringe third parties' intellectual property
    rights.
</p>

<h4><a name="CLA4"></a>Do I lose the rights to my work if I contribute code to
    Zend Framework after having signed the CLA?</h4>
<p>
    No. By signing the CLA you do grant Zend the right to use your
    contribution, but as stated in the CLA, "You reserve all right, title, and
    interest in and to Your Contributions."
</p>

<h4><a name="CLA5"></a>I am a minor child (i.e. under 18 years of age). Who
    should sign the CLA?</h4>
<p>
    A CLA for a contributor under the age of 18 should be signed
    by both the contributor and the contributor's legal guardian.
</p>

<h4><a name="CLA6"></a> What kind of contribution requires I submit a CLA?
    What kind of contribution can I make without submitting a CLA?</h4>
<p>
    You must sign a CLA before Zend Framework can accept any content that
    constitutes intellectual property.  This is anything that could carry a
    copyright or be based on a patent.  This includes <b>code</b>, <b>patches</b>,
    <b>tests</b>, <b>documentation</b>, and even <b>proposals</b> submitted on our
    <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Home">development wiki
    site</a>.  You do not need to submit a CLA to report a bug or make a feature
    request in our <a href="http://framework.zend.com/issues">issue tracker</a>, or
    to ask a question on the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/wiki/x/GgE">mailing
    lists</a>.  You can include code to illustrate your words, but your code cannot
    be incorporated into Zend Framework unless it is submitted under the terms of
    the CLA.

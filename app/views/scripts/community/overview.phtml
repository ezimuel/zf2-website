Zend Framework is a lot more than code. It's a community.

<div class="dotted-line"></div>

<p>
    Zend Framework has hundreds of contributors and our users number in the hundreds of thousands.
    We can't thank this vibrant community enough for their many contributions of code, tests, 
    documentation, and support over the years.
</p>
<p>
Simply put: we haven't just built a framework together. We've built a community.

If you are looking
for the latest production version of Zend Framework, it can be found 
in the <a href="/download/latest">latest release section</a>.

We package several Zend Framework downloads for your convenience, many of which are available on Zend's
high-speed <a href="http://www.zend.com/community/downloads">content distribution network</a>

greater bandwidth, you'll get your files sooner and we'll have more bandwidth for serving the ZF

All compressed archives are available in both zip (.zip) and tarball (.tar.gz) formats.

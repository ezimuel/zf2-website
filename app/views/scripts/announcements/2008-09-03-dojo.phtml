<p class="first">Zend Framework and Dojo Partner Up</p>
<div class="dotted-line"></div>

<p>In May 2008, we announced a partnership between Dojo and Zend
Framework. The goal was to deliver an out-of-the-box solution for
building Ajax-based Web applications using Zend Framework. This
integration is mainly targeted at users who rely on us to recommend a
JavaScript toolkit and some Ajax best practices along with it.</p>

<p>Zend Framework 1.6 is the first release to include features developed
as part of this partnership. These features include:</p>
<ul class="ul">
	<li>A dojo() placeholder view helper to facilitate Dojo integration in
	your views, including setting up the required script and style tags,
	dojo.require statements, and more. In essence, this supports and
	enhances Dojo's modularity at the application level.</li>

	<li>Zend_View helpers and Zend_Form elements and decorators that
	utilize Dijit, Dojoâ€™s layout and widget platform. This simplifies
	creation of Zend_Form elements that can be rendered as Dijits. For
	instance, highly interactive widgets such as calendar choosers, time
	selectors, and combo-boxes are provided.</li>

	<li>Zend_Dojo_Data, a component for creating dojo.data-compatible
	response payloads. dojo.data defines a standard storage interface;
	services providing data in this format can then be consumed by a
	variety of Dojo facilities to provide highly flexible and dynamic
	content for your user interfaces.</li>

	<li>A JSON-RPC server component: Zend_Json_Server. JSON-RPC is a
	lightweight remote procedure call protocol, utilizing JSON for its
	serialization format; it is useful for sites that require a high volume
	of interaction between the user interface and server-side data stores,
	as it allows exposing your server-side APIs in a format directly
	accessible via your client. Dojo has native JSON-RPC capabilities, and
	Zend Framework provides a JSON-RPC implementation that is both
	compatible with Dojo and the published specifications.</li>
</ul>

<p>We evaluated several JavaScript toolkits and decided to recommend
Dojo for several reasons:</p>
<ol class="ol">
	<li>
	<p><b>Licensing</b></p>

	<p>Zend Framework and Dojo are both licensed under the new BSD license,
	allowing end users to integrate, alter, and distribute each project as
	they wish. In integrating with Dojo, Zend Framework continues to
	deliver business-friendly licensing along with its full Ajax support.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>IP Purity</b></p>

	<p>The Zend Framework and Dojo projects both require all contributors to
	sign Apache-style Contributor License Agreements, which mitigates the
	risk of accepting contributions that infringe upon third parties'
	intellectual property rights.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>Design Affinity</b></p>

	<p>Both projects have similar design philosophies, including a strong
	emphasis on use-at-will architecture. Additionally, each has rigorous
	quality guidelines with strict unit testing and coding standards.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>JSON Format</b></p>

	<p>While Dojo can accept XHR responses in a variety of formats, JSON is
	the preferred response format. Zend Framework fully supports JSON for
	Ajax interactions, and already has a variety of helpers to facilitate
	data transmission via JSON. JSON is a lightweight format, can be
	evaluated directly in JavaScript, and presents an elegant solution to
	the problem of data representation in XHR requests.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>Comprehensive Ajax Solution</b></p>

	<p>Dojo provides a comprehensive solution for rich web user interfaces.
	Many other toolkits either abstract common DOM-related actions to make
	remoting more efficient or focus solely on the UI layer; Dojo provides
	utilities for all of these.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>Use of Standards</b></p>

	<p>Dojo not only implements published standards, but also drives them.
	For example, members of the Dojo Foundation are working on draft
	versions of the JSON-RPC, JSON-Schema, and Bayeux Protocol
	specifications to promote interoperability among JavaScript libraries.
	In addition, Dojo is adopting and implementing standards driven by the
	OpenAjax Alliance including the OpenAjax Hub for interoperability.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>Support</b></p>

	<p>There are dedicated organizations behind both that allow customers
	to benefit from a fully supported stack. Zend offers support for PHP,
	Zend Framework and its application server offering while SitePen has
	support offerings for Dojo. Depending on customer demand the companies
	may also create joint support offerings in the future.</p>
	</li>

	<li>
	<p><b>Community</b></p>

	<p>Both projects foster very strong and active communities that can
	support each other. Visit <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/community">http://dojotoolkit.org/community</a>
	and <a href="http://framework.zend.com/community">http://framework.zend.com/community</a>
	for more information on how to participate.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>While we will recommend and build integration points with Dojo, Zend
Framework will continue to be largely Ajax toolkit agnostic. Only those
who seek out-of-the-box Ajax functionality in the standard library will
require Dojo. Additionally, we expect that the various Dojo-related
components and helpers added to Zend Framework will serve as a blueprint
for similar components serving alternate Ajax toolkits developed by the
Zend Framework community. While we don't have immediate plans to support
them directly, we may ship such community contributions in the future.</p>

<p>The Dojo Toolkit project will, for its part, also continue being
server-side framework agnostic. In essence, this collaboration should
not be taken as a move towards exclusivity in either project; rather, it
adds features in each project to facilitate interoperability between
Zend Framework and the Dojo Toolkit.</p>

by Zend Framework, we have <a href="/demo_dojo/preview">prepared a
demonstration application</a>.</p>

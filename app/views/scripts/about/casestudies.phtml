<h3>Fox Interactive Media - IGN Entertainment division</h3>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.fox.com/" target="_blank">Fox</a> Interactive Media's
    IGN Entertainment division is one of the premier providers of online digital
    entertainment, with properties such as <a href="http://www.ign.com" target="_blank">IGN.com</a>,
    <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com" target="_blank">RottenTomatoes.com</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.askmen.com" target="_blank">AskMen.com</a>.</p>
<p>
    IGN Entertainment's team at IGN community sites manages over 50 different community-based sites
    and has built an entirely new platform based on Zend Framework.  Things the team wanted to
    accomplish with this new platform included:
<ul class="ul">
    <li>Eliminate code duplication in their legacy PHP applications
</li>
    <li>Develop code that was easy to maintain and easy to extend</li>
    <li>Build a library of core/base functionality across their sites: articles, comments, ratings,
media (video/stills), viewer polls, etc.</li>
    <li>Make extensive use of a database model design with built-in validation</li>
    <li>Use the IGN internal standard templating system Smarty for their producers, designers,
and artists</li>
    <li>Boosts in performance were a welcome side-benefit of most of the above</li>
</ul>
Several different core backend applications existed prior to the IGN community group
taking on these sites, but none of them were built on proven best practices or design
patterns such as the well-known Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern--IGN needed to improve the codebase so they
could work quickly and more efficiently to develop new applications and to make it easier for
their online properties to constantly change and adapt to new products and markets.
</p>

<blockquote>"Zend Framework is incredibly effective
for IGN because it does not impose its
structure, and allows us to make our
own architectural decisions."
</blockquote>
<strong><blockquote>-- Tony Ford,
Engineering Manager,
IGN Entertainment</blockquote></strong>
<p>
    Sites already built on Zend Framework include
    <a href="http://grandtheftauto.ign.com/" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto 'Hood</a>,
    <a href="http://supersmashbros.ign.com/" target="_blank">Super Smash Bros World</a>, and

    rolled out over time.

<h3>IBM Software Group</h3>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.ibm.com/" target="_blank">IBM</a> Research &amp
    Development Labs' Emerging Internet Technologies, led by CTO David Boloker, has
    chosen Zend Framework to build and deliver their ambitious QEDWiki project on.
</p>
<p>
    The <a href="http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/qedwiki/"
    target="_blank">QEDWiki</a> browser-based assembly canvas lets business users
    build mash-ups and situational applications from their own data sources and to
    design UI and business logic components onscreen.  It has been engineered by
    IBM using many Zend Framework components.
</p>
<p>
    QEDWiki, which allows line of business professionals to assemble mash-ups
    from disparate web services and other sources on demand, uses Zend Framework to
    provide Ajax responsiveness and Web Services data to &amp; from QEDWiki, as
    well as support a number of database adapters that allow QEDWiki users to
    collect data directly from their enterprise data sources.  "From the start we
    have embraced and contributed to the Zend Framework project, and are very
    excited to deliver our product based on the release of Zend Framework 1.0" said
    David Boloker, CTO for Emerging Internet Technologies, IBM Software Group.

<h3>Indianapolis Motor Speedway</h3>

    Home of the <a href="http://www.indy500.com/" target="_blank">Indy 500</a> race
    and owned by the <a href="http://www.clabbergirl.com" target="_blank">Clabber Girl</a>
    corporation (est. 1879), the <a href="http://indianapolismotorspeedway.com" target="_blank">
    Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a> (IMS) maintains over two dozen sites and they have chosen
    to standardize their PHP website development on Zend Framework.
</p>
<p>
    Indianapolis Motor Speedway is a LAMP stack shop, using exclusively open-source based code,
    but also making use of key enabling tools from Zend, including Zend Studio for Eclipse and
    the web application server Zend Platform.
</p>
    Some of the new Zend Framework features the IMS team is using are:
<ul class="ul">
    <li><span>Layouts</span> - let's IMS punch-in new content and rapidly deploy it</li>
    <li><span>Action Helpers & Partials</span> - allows IMS to separate their code into logical parts,
    making them easier to use in conjunction with the best practice coding standards ZF promotes</li>
    <li><span>Zend_View_Enhanced</span> - a new standard IMS uses to build plugins and action helpers</li>
    <li><span>Zend_Cache</span> - for caching, supported by the Zend application server, Zend Platform</li>
</ul>

<h3>Right Media</h3>
<p>
    In 2005 <a href="http://www.rightmedia.com/" target="_blank">Right
    Media</a> launched the <a href="http://www.rightmedia.com/content/right-media-exchange/1.php"
    target="_blank">Right Media Exchange</a>, in which advertisers and publishers
    buy and sell online ad placements in real time through auctions, with Right
    Media&rsquo;s optimization technology predicting where the ads will work best.
</p>
<p>
    Right Media serves 4 to 5 billion ads per day and at times
    processes over 100,000 requests/second.  They have a network of 19,000
    advertisers and publishers that access the platform to enter, update, confirm,
    and place advertisements. However, with the success of the Exchange came some
    problems.
</p>
<p>
    At first Right Media provided their customers a Windows-based desktop
    application to let users post ads, create inventory, bid, and sell on the
    auction, track results, etc. But that solution turned out to be unworkable
    because the product was hard to maintain, and the team was overwhelmed by
    support issues and customers&rsquo; resistance to frequent updates that were
    needed to add new and improved functionality.

<h3>Varien - Magento eCommerce Platform</h3>

    In business since 2001, <a href="http://www.varien.com/"
    target="_blank">Varien</a> has been building e-commerce solutions for major
    clients for over half the lifetime of significant e-commerce on the web.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/" target="_blank">Magento</a>
    open-source e-commerce engine that Varien has developed uses PHP 5 and Zend
    Framework because of the large open-source ecosystem that supports and enhances
    their investment in Zend Framework.
</p>

<p>
    "We considered Java &amp; Struts, and had many discussions among our team
    on which technology to use for Magento (our new e-commerce engine), but once we
    knew Zend was behind the open-source Zend Framework, encapsulating and
    supporting the features we needed for our large corporate and enterprise
    clients, we immediately chose Zend Framework.  We're extremely happy with our
    decision," said Roy Rubin, CEO at Varien.

<h3>bwin Games AB</h3>
<p>
    <a href="http://www.bwin.ag/page.aspx?view=aboutus&lang=en"
    target="_blank">bwin Interactive AG</a>'s subsidiary bwin Games AB based in
    Stockholm, has completely re-architected their site <a
    href="http://www.pokerroom.com/" target="_blank">PokerRoom.com</a> using PHP 5
    and Zend Framework.
</p>

<p>
    The bwin Games team makes extensive use of the model-view-controller (MVC)
    industry-standard for designing web applications. Their multi-tier design uses
    Zend Framework's MVC implementation, is based on best practices including
    coding guidelines, and ensures separation of concerns using layers that
    communicate between the different logical parts of their application. This
    means their front-end designers can work independently and efficiently in
    conjunction with server-side PHP developers, meaning everyone saves time, stays
    in their own areas of expertise, and achieves greater productivity overall.
</p>

<blockquote>
    bwin Games AB, a subsidiary of bwin Interactive Entertainment AG, is a world leader in
    digital entertainment with a focus on poker and other online gaming. They develop and
    market everything from stand-alone products, to turnkey solutions in poker, and casino
    games for digital media. The company owns one of the world's most popular poker
    networks, Ongame Network, with around 12 million registered players and have several

    gaming company in the world that exclusively markets to the gaming public at large.

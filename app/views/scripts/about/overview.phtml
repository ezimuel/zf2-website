<p class="first">
    Extending the art &amp; spirit of PHP, Zend Framework is based
    on simplicity, object-oriented best practices, corporate friendly licensing,
    and a rigorously tested agile codebase.  Zend Framework is focused on building
    more secure, reliable, and modern Web 2.0 applications &amp; web services, and
    consuming widely available APIs from leading vendors like
    <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata" target="_blank">Google</a>,
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>,
    <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Yahoo!</a>,
    <a href="http://flickr.com/services/" target="_blank">Flickr</a>,
    as well as API providers and cataloguers like
    <a href="http://www.strikeiron.com/" target="_blank">StrikeIron</a> and
    <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/" target="_blank">ProgrammableWeb</a>.<br/><br/>

<h3>Extreme Simplicity &amp; Productivity</h3>
<p>
    We designed Zend Framework with simplicity in mind.  To provide
    a lightweight, loosely-coupled component library simplified to provide 4/5s of
    the functionality everyone needs and that lets you customize the other 20% to
    meet your specific business needs.  By focusing on the most commonly needed
    functionality, we retain the simplified spirit of PHP programming, dramatically
    lower the learning curve, and your training costs &ndash; so developers get
    up-to-speed quickly. We do this with:
</p>

<ul class="list-features">
    <li class="feature1"><img src="/images/icon_feature1.gif" width="41" height="38" alt="" />Extensible and<br />well-tested code base</li>
    <li class="feature2"><img src="/images/icon_feature2.gif" width="28" height="39" alt="" />Flexible architecture</li>
    <li class="feature3"><img src="/images/icon_feature3.gif" width="34" height="34" alt="" />No configuration files<br />necessary to get going</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Frameworks and best practices mean reduced training costs and
    quicker time-to-market &ndash; important factors in adoption decisions. Built
    so you can pick and choose just the pieces you need to turbocharge your web
    applications &ndash; all your developers know where to find their PHP / Zend
    Framework code, speeding new development and reducing maintenance costs.

<h3>Fully Tested &ndash; Extend Safely and Easily</h3>
<p>
    Tested. Thoroughly. Enterprise-ready and built with agile
    methods, Zend Framework has been unit-tested from the start, with stringent
    code coverage requirements to ensure that all code contributed has not only
    been thoroughly unit-tested, but also remains stable and easy for you to
    extend, re-test with your extensions, and further maintain.

This is the github repository of the Zend Framework web site
http://framework.zend.com.

The source code of the web site is not complete. We removed some parts like the
manuals but almost all the web site is here. For instance the ZF2 module is fully
included (http://framework.zend.com/zf2).

This web site uses the libraries ZF 1.11 and ZF 2.0.0beta3.

To run this web site on your local machine you have to configure the following
files:

- /document_root/index.php (add your ZF 1.11 path, on line 11)

- /app/etc/config.ini (be sure that the cache.baseDir folder is writable from
  the web server)

- /app/jobs/agilezen.php (configure only if you want to update the kanban data)
   - add your ZF 2.0.0beta3 path, on line 19
   - add the API key of AgileZen, on line 30;

- /app/jobs/invite_agile.php (configure only if you want to activate the invitation
  of AgileZen in the kanban system)
   - add your ZF 2.0.0beta3 path, on line 19;
   - add the API key of AgileZen, on line 31;
   - add the path to the log file, on line 60.
